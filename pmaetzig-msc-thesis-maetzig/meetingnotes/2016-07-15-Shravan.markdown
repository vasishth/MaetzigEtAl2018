# Meeting on MSc (10/2016--...)

## Data from Caplan (2015)

The data that Caplan published in his 2015 paper are with Shravan. At the moment,
there is not yet a list deciphering what the different indices mean, but for now 
the association of 'seg' to region of interest should be easy (see script in 
'~/.../msc\ thesis'). 

Some notes on the data:
- current data (`rcdata.txt`) is only a subset of the original data, subsetted 
by columns and also rows (only for SR/OR constructions, so basically two
conditions)
- Shravan will share complete data later on (probably via dropbox)

## Todo until next Friday (2016-07-22)
- fix segments a-e to region names
- for Caplan data, summarise SO/SS data by subject and region with CI
- Shravan will send code (analysis for diff. data), including vignette, with 
ready-made functions for region mean and CI calculation **see email**

## ACT-R 
- re-download ACT-R from Felix' github
- generate reading times for subjects, generate subj mean + SE

## Other notes from the meeting
- package for reading in excel documents in R: `xlsx`, needs some weird java dependencies
- when Shravan tried it there was a memory error during loading, research this?
