# Status quo

- performed preliminary analysis of some combinations of :ans, :dat and :ga parameters
- ERROR: :dat parameter in some simulation series way to high (0.5 instead of 0.05 e.g.), e.g. in series GG-EXP1-20160927-2311
- current simulations for parameter settings might not replicate, but be noise

# TODO[paul]

- delete 2311 with wrong :dat parameter values and rerun
- **model checking:**
    - for all the current parameter combinations, rerun 100 iterations 4 times each
    - with these data, plot TRT (additionally also other measures?) for OR/SR
      in relation to run (1--4)
    - *purpose:* check whether the patterns for non-standard parameter settings
      replicate
- **model predictions:**
    - for 100 iterations each, gather predictions for all the parameter 
      combinations until today
    - more fine-grained parameter sweep for :ans necessary (step width
      something like 0.02 or even 0.01)
    - in a data frame, for TRT, gather mean values + CI (or similar) comparing
      embedded and main verb, for each parameter combination (see image below)
    - *purpose:*
        - understand the influence of the three parameters on model 
          performance, as well as the influence of their combinations
- **getting proportions of correct attachments:**
    - for each of the iterations (should make a smaller selection first of
      those parameter combinations that look promising), extract verbose
      ACT-R output of each iteration and pipe to .txt file
    - use *awk* (or python) to extract all lines which contain `+++  Relation: "DOG" is "subject" of "BIT"  +++`
      and pipe to .txt again
    - calculate proportions of correct retrievals from this
    - compare these proportions with the Caplan (2015) data; more specifically, 
      to the comprehension question response accuracy from the aphasics
      (should also compare Caplan's Q response accuracy data of healthy controls
      to the ACT-R simulations with default model parameters)

# future goals

- check whether :ga parameter can be used to model working memory differences
