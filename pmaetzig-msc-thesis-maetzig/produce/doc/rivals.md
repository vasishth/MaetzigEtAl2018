Potential rivals to produce in that they also support multiple wildcards in
some way:

* [plmake](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=plmake) is written in Prolog,
  very interesting because it's a great language for declarative programming
* [zymake](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ebreck/code/zymake/) not only
  supports multiple wildcards but actively manages multiple variables that the
  user wants to include in target names so e.g. you don't have to/get to the
  structure of your filenames yourself. This means a bit less freedom and
  generality, but may be just right for the purpose of automating scientific
  experiments. Definitely need to give that one a try some time.
