Q: Python is not a suitable language for inline computations/expansions because
   you need newlines and indentations.

A: %{...} expansions can contain newlines and indentation. In order not to
   break the flow of values they are part of, consider using an intemediate
   variable:

   [target%{i}.txt]
   a = %{
       def f(x): # start with newline and four spaces
           return x - 1

       f(int(i)) # TODO make it so that this works!
       }
   # closing brace also indented four spaces
   dep.previous = target%{a}.txt
   recipe = cp %{previous} %{target}
