    A test where the dependency graph has a large number of nodes (4096). Old
    thread-based Produce would crash because it created a thread for every
    target. New asyncio-based Produce handles it with ease.

    This test is currently not included in the test suite because it takes
    very long, illustrating the unfortunately high overhead of Producers.
