Very minimal example to test targets that are specified using regular
expressions. Try

$ produce out/test.dev.out

As you can see in produce.ini, if a section name starts and ends with a slash,
the string in-between is interpreted as a Python regular expression, rather
than a Produce pattern. This affords more control over the form of the targets
a rule matches. For example, this one checks for the occurrence of the string
dev or test.

Produce variable references %{...} cannot be used in regular expressions.
Instead, use named groups. For example, what the subexpression (?<corpus>.*)
matches will be assigned to the Produce variable corpus. It can then be
referred to in the body of the rule.

Note that although slashes enclose the regular expression, it is not necessary
to escape slashes occurring within it.
